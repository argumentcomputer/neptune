## About
Neptune is a Rust implementation of the [Poseidon hash function](https://www.poseidon-hash.info/) tuned for
[Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/).

Neptune has been [audited by ADBK Consulting](poseidon-in-filecoin-final-report.pdf) and deemed fully compliant with the
paper ([Starkad and Poseidon: New Hash Functions for Zero Knowledge Proof
Systems](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/458.pdf)).

Neptune is specialized to the [BLS12-381 curve](https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-snark-curve/). Although the API allows
for type specialization to other fields, the round numbers, constants, and s-box selection may not be correct. Do not do
this.

Hashes of arbitrary arities are generally supported — but secure round numbers have only been calculated for a
selection (including especially 2, 4, and 8 — which are explicitly, rather than incidentally, supported). [Filecoin
Proofs](https://github.com/filecoin-project/rust-fil-proofs) make heavy use of 8-ary merkle trees and merkle inclusion
proofs (in SNARKs).

Neptune also supports batch hashing and tree building, which can be performed on a GPU. The underlying GPU
implementation, [neptune-triton](https://github.com/filecoin-project/neptune-triton) is implemented in the [Futhark
Programming Language](https://futhark-lang.org/). To use `neptune-triton` GPU batch hashing, compile `neptune` with the
`gpu` feature.

Neptune now implements GPU batch hashing in pure OpenCL. The initial implementation is a bit less than 2x faster than
the Futhark implementation, so once stabilized this will likely be the preferred option. The pure OpenCL batch hashing
is provided by the internal `proteus` module. To use `proteus`, compile `neptune` with the `opencl` feature.

The `gpu` and `opencl` features are mutually exclusive.

At the time of the 1.0.0 release, Neptune on RTX 2080Ti GPU can build 8-ary Merkle trees for 4GiB of input in 16 seconds.

## Implementation Specification

Filecoin's Poseidon specification is published in the Filecoin specification document [here](https://spec.filecoin.io/#section-algorithms.crypto.poseidon). Additionally, a PDF version is mirrored in this repo [here](poseidon_spec.pdf).

## Environment variables

 - `NEPTUNE_DEFAULT_GPU=<pci-id>` allows you to select the default GPU that tree-builder is going to run on given its pci-id.

(Bus-id is a decimal integer that can be found through `nvidia-smi`, `rocm-smi`, `lspci` and etc.)

## Future Work

The following are likely areas of future work:

- [x] Support for multiple GPUs.
- [x] Support domain separation tag.
- [x] Improve throughput (?) by using OpenCL directly.

## History

Neptune was originally bootstrapped from [Dusk's reference implementation](https://github.com/dusk-network/dusk-poseidon-merkle).
